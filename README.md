- [Neat is Neat Senior Project](https://github.com/MikeUchmanowicz/Neat-is-Neat-Senior-Project/) - *Python, Pygame, Django, NEAT AI*  

  Currently designing and creating a simple "endless scroller" game within python with an implemented evolutionary Artificial Intelligence in order to play the game. The project's purpose is to explore the concepts of NEAT. The game will upload AI info/results to a database post-game which an included full-stack django webapp will retrieve from an SQL database and display both in a list and in a graph. The django webapp also features user registration and authentication.


- [Inventory Store CRUD Springboot](https://github.com/MikeUchmanowicz/Inventory-Store-CRUD-Springboot/) - *Java, Springboot, Thymeleaf, JavaScript*  

  Designed and created (collaboratory team of 2) a crud webapp that supports polymorphism and different items. Users are able to register, login, view their own inventory, view the "store" inventory, purchase items from the "store", and add each other as friends. An Admin user can create, edit, and delete products within the "store". An SQL database stores products, users, and friendships. Utilizes: IoC, SoC, & N-Layer architecture.


- [Contacts API / Full Stack CRUD Webapp](https://github.com/MikeUchmanowicz/ContactsAPI) - *JS Express, JS Angular*  

  Created a Contacts API back end using express which allows for the creating, reading, updating, and deleting of contacts and notes associated with them. Contacts and notes are stored in a MySQL database. A front end using angular was then added to the application which provides users with a seamless UI.


- [Springboot Cloud "Lift n' Shift"](https://github.com/MikeUchmanowicz/SpringBootLiftNShift) - *Springboot stack, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Heroku*  

  I created a springboot application and hosted it within several clouds: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, and Heroku. The cloud hosted springboot Application features a home page and a "pseudo-login", allowing for any input which will take the user to an orders page. The user can see all orders which are retrieved from a MySQL database hosted by the same cloud host.


- Inventory Client & Admin Services Console App - *Java*

  REPO CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION   
  Designed and Created a multithreaded console app that supports polymorphism and websockets. The app allows for a client connection to an inventory store in which the     client can view, sort, and purchase items. These items are different types. An admin can connect and update the inventory via a json string or view the inventory         returned as json. The admin and client connections can be run asynchronously.   


- Minesweeper Full-Stack Webapp - *C#, ASP.NET, JavaScript*

  REPO CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION   
  Created and Deployed (as a collaboratory team of 4) a full-stack minesweeper webapp to Azure. Features include: registration, logging in, a playable minesweeper game,   saving of progress in game, and the playing of saved games. An SQL database is implemented to store users and saved games. Utilizes: SoC
