Currently designing and creating (as a collaboratory team of 2) a crud webapp that supports polymorphism and different items. Users will be able to register, login, view their own inventory, view the "store" inventory, purchase items from the "store", and trade with each other. An SQL database will store products, users, and each user's inventories. Utilizes: IoC and SoC.

- Inventory Client & Admin Services Console App - *Java*  
Designed and Created a multithreaded console app that supports polymorphism and websockets. The app allows for a client connection to an inventory store in which the client can view, sort, and purchase items. These items are different types. An admin can connect and update the inventory via a json string or view the inventory returned as json. The admin and client connections can be run asynchronously.
